# Web Page Implementation — README

## Overview

This project consists of implementing a fully functional web page from scratch using only **HTML** and **CSS**. No external libraries, frameworks, or plugins are allowed.

The main objective is to recreate the provided designer file as accurately as possible, using the **HTML/CSS, accessibility, and responsive design** skills learned previously.

---

## Requirements

- Build the entire page **from scratch**, without any library or framework.
- Use **semantic HTML** and clean, well-structured CSS.
- Ensure the page is **responsive** on different screen sizes.
- Follow **accessibility best practices** (proper tags, alt text, readability, etc.).
- The final result should look **the same as the designer file** in layout, spacing, colors, and typography.

---

## What To Deliver

- A complete, working web page that visually matches the designer file.
- Functionality such as navigation links, buttons, and layout interactions should work as expected.
- Proper file structure (HTML, CSS, assets).
- Final webpage must be **pixel-consistent** with the design.

## Technologies Allowed

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (No CSS frameworks, no JS libraries, no preprocessors.)

## Goal

The goal is simple:  
To create a **fully functional web page** that looks **identical to the designer’s mockup** — using only the core web technologies I learned.
